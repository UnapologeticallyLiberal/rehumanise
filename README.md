# ![logo] rehumanise ![logo]


A cross-browser extension that seeks to unmask evil for what it is.

The code itself is still WIP and not quite up to my own standards, yet.

Contributors: Feel free to feature requests to the [issues][issue-link] section

PS: Those wondering why I picked a white rose for a logo might want to
look into the [White Rose][White-Rose-Wiki]. A non-violent student organisation
which opposed the original Nazi regime in the early 1940s.
